We see that if we use -Ofast, the result gets flushed to 0. However this also
significantly improves the time performance.

If we set tiny to 1e-50, we see that our number is so small that it directly
becomes 0. Thus the number is not denormalized anymore and the code already runs
way fast without any optimization flags.
