memset
    - Expectation: The fast one should be faster since we dont iterate through a
    loop.
    - Results: 0.12 for slow and 0.01 for fast, when -Ofast same speed

lookup
    - Expectation: fast one should be better due to just memory acces
    - Result: 0.22 slow and 0.12 fast, still stands with 0.14 vs 0.0 after optimization
    - In general every function where we get some input more frequent then other, especially if they are way more costly

strength_reduction
    - output in 0.52s:
        1 2 3 1, 0.100000 0.500000 0.330000
        30 480 32 16, 0.496241 0.660000 0.373113
    - we get it down to 0.07, could get it further but then no computations anymore??

math_functions
    - pow: 0.45
    - sqrt: 0.03
    - sqrtf: 0.03
The two sqrt functions are the fastest. I think this happens because sqrt is optimized for roots whereas pow is optimized for "normal" powers
