- we see that if nested is disabled, our inner parallelization is ignored

merge sort:
    - n= 10000000
    - baseline: 1.821
    - 2: 0.882
    - 4: 0.580
    - 8: 0.448

with just one malloc:
    - 4: 0.411
    - 8: 0.391
we get a greater speedup because we dont need to synchronize malloc and free
