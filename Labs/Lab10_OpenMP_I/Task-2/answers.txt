- we need a long int since the loop variable max value is too large for int (max: 2,147,483,647)
- execution time:
    1: 10.23
    4: 10.311673
    5: 10.217040s
    8: 10.504926s
    10: 12.796438s

- see same time for 1 to 8 cores, (interesting, since we have only 4 high-performance-cores)
- if we go over 8, time increases
