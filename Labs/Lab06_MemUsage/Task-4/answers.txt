- restrict doesnt seem to improve performance up to now
- no we didnt get an improvement in performance from changing no to NP
- by adding the const keyword, we get a big performance improvement down from 0.197s to 0.037s
- if we move our variable inside the function, it doesnt change wether we use
const or not. I think this is because since NP is a local variable now, the
compiler can be sure that nobody else changes it and since it doesnt get changed
inside the function thus declare it a const itself
