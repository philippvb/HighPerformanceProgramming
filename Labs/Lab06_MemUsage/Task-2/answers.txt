- if we leave out the typedef, we get an unknown type error
- if we define typedef after, we only get error in the sorting algs
- int: 0.106
- char 0.100
- short int: 0.103
- long int: 0.108
- long int: 0.108

-> char gives best performance, I think since it is the shortest type so
comparisons take the least amount of time

- since none of the other ints are used to compare, I think the time difference
would be neglible. However in case of large lists, small types like char
wouldn't be able to fit the number for example in loops anymore
